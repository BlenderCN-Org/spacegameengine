<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
This site exists to give you an overview of all the libraries and projects
related to the graphics engine <em>sge</em> and also to give you some pointers
on where to look if you want to get involved.
</p>
<a name="history"></a>
<h3>History</h3>
<p>
After meditating over Stroustrup's great tome &quot;The C++ programming
language&quot; for over 9000 years, <strong>Freundlich</strong> started a one-man C++ project to
develop some sort of &quot;space game.&quot; Initially using Windows and
DirectX, he quickly hacked together something useful. But in a one-man project,
it's hard to keep motivating yourself.
</p>
<p>
So about a year after its inception, <strong>Phillemann</strong> joined sge and
the project developed more quickly. Some time later, they both agreed to work
on a game called <em>sanguis</em> together. This time, however, it wasn't
supposed to be a space game. It was supposed to be a down shooter in the style
of <a href="http://www.crimsonland.com/">Crimsonland</a> or <a
href="http://code.google.com/p/violetland/">violetland</a>. This is when
<strong>nille</strong> joined the team as a graphics and sound artist.
During the development of sanguis, it became apparent that sge was too
monolithic. A lot of the functions and concepts were too general to be in a
graphics engine. For example, sge had a logging facility, a math library and so
forth. So a decision was made to move the general stuff to a new library,
<em>fcppt</em>. Later on, a few other libraries were spawned, like <em>awl</em>
and <em>mizuiro</em>.

Developers
</h2>
<p>
Philipp Reh a.k.a. <a href="https://github.com/freundlich">Freundlich</a> (founder and main developer of libawl, mizuiro, sge and sanguis)
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://github.com/pmiddend">Phillemann</a> (main developer of sge and <a href="http://fruitcut.com">fruitcut</a>)
</p>
<a name="philosophy"></a>
<h2>Philosophy</h2>
<p>
There are a lot of graphics engines out there. Most prominently, there are <a
href="http://irrlicht.sourceforge.net/">irrlicht</a> and <a
href="http://www.ogre3d.org/">ogre</a>. But those aren't the only ones. So, should
I choose sge over those two? The answer is: it depends.
</p>
<p>
It's often a little hard to define how a library stands out among others. sge's
focus, however, is pretty clear. It's supposed to be an engine written in
<em>standards-compliant, exception-safe, memory-leak free, modern C++</em> that
offers at least a <em>low-level</em> API to the usual tasks involving a game
engine.
</p>
<p>
To that end, sge is developed on multiple platforms on multiple compilers
and with rigid warning settings. Exception safety is guaranteed by sticking to
the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RAII">RAII</a> principle, providing
<code>scoped_</code> classes for everything that's supposed to end when the
scope ends. Also, sge uses all of C++'s features where appropriate, so a
standards-compliant compiler is assumed.  The <a
href="http://boost.org">boost</a> library is heavily used in the project, as
well as tr1.
</p>
<p>
We also try to avoid common anti-patterns such as the singleton pattern, or
designing needlessly huge base classes (consider ogre's <a
href="http://www.ogre3d.org/docs/api/html/classOgre_1_1Node.html">node</a> or
<a href="http://www.ogre3d.org/docs/api/html/classOgre_1_1SceneNode.html">scene
node</a> class, for example). Conversely, we try to keep our code clean using
the <strong>named parameter idiom</strong>, <strong>strong typedefs</strong>,
<strong>small (atomic) headers</strong>, using <strong>namespaces</strong> and
strictly <strong>separating the hpp and cpp files</strong> (function
definitions all inside the cpp file, not inlined inside the class).
</p>
<a name="whatdoesitoffer"></a>
<h3>What does sge offer?</h3>
<ul>
<li>
A complete <strong>renderer interface</strong> with backends for
<strong>DirectX</strong> (in development) and <strong>OpenGL</strong>
(considered mature). There's a really nice (modern C++y) abstraction layer over
<strong>vertex buffers</strong>. There is, however, <strong>no shader
abstraction</strong> if you want to be independent of HLSL or GLSL.
</li>
<li>
A very abstract, yet optimized <strong>sprite system</strong> supporting
<strong>point sprites</strong>.
</li>
<li>
The ability load <strong>truetype fonts</strong> (via <a
href="http://www.freetype.org/">freetype</a> plugin) and <strong>bitmap
fonts</strong> with an interface which is agnostic as to what specific type of
font you're using.
</li>
<li>
An <strong>audio subsystem</strong> supporting streaming sounds (for background
music) and non-streaming sounds. With loaders for <strong>wave</strong> and
<strong>Ogg/Vorbis</strong> and with an <strong>OpenAL</strong> player backend.
</li>
<li>
Abstractions for <strong>timers</strong>
</li>
<li>
Parsers for <strong>json</strong> and <strong>ini</strong> files.
</li>
<li>
A <strong>plugin system</strong>, bundled with <strong>well-thought
interfaces</strong> allowing you to easily write new backends and loaders.
</li>
</ul>
<a name="drawbacks"></a>
<h3>Drawbacks</h3>
<ul>
<li>For all libraries except fcppt, there's <strong>no documentation</strong>
available. The projects are too volatile to provide documentation, so instead we
try to keep the header files as clean and descriptive as possible.
</li>
<li>
Few <strong>high-level abstractions</strong> are available. Thus, sge is
targeted primarily at users wanting to write portable code, but who do not want
to mess with OpenGL, DirectX, OpenAL etc. themselves. 
</li>
</ul>
