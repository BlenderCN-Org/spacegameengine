\brief Multiplex the output of an ostream to the console and to the original target
\tparam Char The character type
\tparam Traits The according char traits

There are situations where you want to know the output of an ostream (for
example: std::cout, fcppt::io::cout, std::cerr and so on), but do not have a
terminal window to look at (since you're running in full-screen mode, for example).

A console (an sge::console::object, to be precise), might be present, however.
So it would be great if you could redirect the output of the given ostream to
the console. This is what the muxing_streambuf does.
