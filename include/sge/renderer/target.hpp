/**
 * \brief A target used to render off screen
 *
 * This class represents a target that can render off screen. At least, it has
 * to be supplied with a color surface for index zero before it can be used for
 * rendering. Such a color surface is usually obtained from a texture level. A
 * texture whose texture level should be used as a color surface in an
 * offscreen target must be created with
 * renderer::texture::capabilities::render_target. A color surface at level one
 * or higher cannot be used with the fixed function pipeline. A depth stencil
 * surface can also be supplied so that offscreen rendering can use a depth or
 * a stencil buffer, respectively. Such a depth stencil surface can either be
 * created by renderer::device::create_depth_stencil_surface or obtained from a
 * depth stencil texture. Initially, the target has no color surfaces and no
 * depth stencil surface and no dimension. The first surface that is set will
 * dictate the dimension of the target, which every other surface must match.
 * If all surfaces are unset, the dimension will also be unset.
 *
