 * \brief Calculates the number of non indexed primitives
 *
 * Calculates how many non indexed primitives of type \a type will be rendered
 * by \a vertices. Non indexed primitives can either be isolated, like
 * triangles and lines, or they can be connected like triangle strips, line
 * strips and line fans.
 *
 * \note Lines needs a multiple of 2 vertices, triangles need a multiple of 3.
 * line strips need at least two vertices, triangle strips and fans need at
 * least 3.
 *
 * \param vertices The number of vertices that will be used
 * \param type The non indexed primitive type
 *
 * \return The number of primitives
 *
 * \throw renderer::exception if vertices has an incorrect value
