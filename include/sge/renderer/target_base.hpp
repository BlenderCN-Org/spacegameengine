 * \brief The base class for render targets
 *
 * This class is the base class of renderer::target, which is an off screen
 * target, and renderer::onscreen_target. It can be used to set and retrieve
 * both the associated viewport and scissor area.
 *
 * The viewport describes a rectangular portion of the target which
 * will be rendered to. Initially, this covers the whole buffer.
 *
 * The scissor area describes a rectangular portion of the target which will be
 * updated when rendering. Initially, the scissor area is unspecified. Scissor
 * tests will only be performed if renderer::state::bool_::enable_scissor_test
 * is true.
