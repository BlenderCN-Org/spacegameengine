\brief Transforms a lock rect into texture coordinates

Calculates the texture coordinates for \a area using the texture size \a size.

\param area The portion of the texture to calculate the coordinates for

\param size The size of the texture

\tparam Ret The floating point type for the resulting rect to use

\return The texture coordinates in [(0,0),(1,1)]

\warning The behaviour is undefined if \a area lies outside of \a size
