 * \brief Calculates the aspect
 *
 * An aspect of a dimension (w,h) is defined as the ratio from the larger to
 * the smaller. The division is done as a floating point division.
 *
 * \param size The size to calculate the aspect from
 *
 * \return <code> size.w > size.h ? size.w / size.h : size.h / size.w </code>
 *
 * \warning The behaviour is undefined if either width or height is zero.
