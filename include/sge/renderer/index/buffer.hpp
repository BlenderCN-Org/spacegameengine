\brief A buffer for storing indices

An index buffer can hold a fixed amount of indices described by an index
format. Currently, there are only two index formats:

<ul>
<li>16 bit indices</li>
<li>32 bit indices</li>
</ul>

After an index buffer has been created, it is immutable, which means that
its size cannot be changed. To store data in it, it has to be locked first,
which will return a view for accessing the data. Unlocking the buffer will
make the update actually take place.
If you want to render indexed geometry, an index buffer must be used.
