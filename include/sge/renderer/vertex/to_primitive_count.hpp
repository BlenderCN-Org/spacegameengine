\brief Calculates how many primitives are described by a number of vertices

The number of vertices given by \a vertices (which could also be indirectly
given by a number of indices) combined with a certain primitive_type given by
\a type describe a certain number of primitives. For example, using the
sge::renderer::primitive_type::triangle_list

\param vertices The number of vertices (or a number of indices used to count
vertices)

\param type The primitive type
