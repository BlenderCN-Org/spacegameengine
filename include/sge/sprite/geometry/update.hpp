\brief Fill sprite geometry into a new buffer slice

Fills sprite geometry from the sprites in \a _range into a new slice obtained
from \a _buffers. \a _compare is used to determine which sprites can be
rendered together.

\param _range The sprite range to use

\param _compare The compare function to determine which sprites can be rendered
together

\param _buffers The buffers to obtain a new slice from

\return A render range which describes how the sprites are rendered
