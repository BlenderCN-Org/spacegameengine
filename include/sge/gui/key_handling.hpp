// This is the return value of the process(key) event and determines if the gui
// should process the key after the widget got it. For example, a widget could
// decide to completely ignore the key (like a button ignores the "tab" key, so
// the manager uses it to cycle the keyboard focus), it could process the key
// and don't let the manager do anything with it (widgets::edit probably wants
// to process the tab key and display a tab character), or it could process the
// key and then hand it over to the manager.
