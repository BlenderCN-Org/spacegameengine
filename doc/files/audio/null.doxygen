\page audio_null audio_null

There is a special audio plugin you might find handy sometimes: audio_null.
It's a plugin that has no dependencies and that "nullifies" all operations. It
doesn't use any audio drivers or backends. sge::audio::file objects are
discarded, no sounds are created or played.

This can be useful for lots of reasons:

<ul>
<li>Some backends such as OpenAL start threads, which complicates debugging. The audio_null plugin doesn't create threads.</li>
<li></li>
</ul>
