/**
\page renderer

\em sge::renderer provides an abstraction for 3D APIs,
which currently is mainly focused on the fixed function pipline
to guarantee maximum portability.
A glsl interface is also provided but can only be used with OpenGL.

The renderer has to manage different types of resources
and allow drawing of them under certain state.

\li Vertices
\li Indices
\li Textures
