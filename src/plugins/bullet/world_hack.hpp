/** 
 * Why this hack? 
 *
 * When a new body is created an added to the world, and if that body collides
 * with another body in the world, no "collision begin" is sent until
 * world::stepSimulation is called. This function "stepSimulation", however,
 * might return _without doing anything_. In stepSimulation, bullet checks if
 * enough time has passed since the last time it was called. Only then does it
 * execute the integration functions. This is to prevent glitches with small
 * float values, I think.
 *
 * The problem is, if you add a body to the world, call stepSimulation and then
 * remove the body again, sometimes no begin callback is sent, and no one
 * notices the object is in the world.
 *
 * So we derive from the "real" bullet world and add a function which calls the
 * integration function with a very small timestep so the callbacks are sent.
